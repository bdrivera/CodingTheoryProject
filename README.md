Discrete Math Project Chapter 5 on Coding Theory

Coding Theory Project was made for my Mathematical Concepts in Computing I (CIS-1166-005) course. For the classes project, I choose the Chapter 5 assignment labelled "Coding Theory". This chapter discusses in depth the representation, manipulation, and transmission of bit strings and bit codes.

This program accomplishes two coding assignments:
1) Given a binary code, determine the number of errors that it can detect and the number of errors that it can correct.
2) Given a binary code with minimum distance k, where k is a positive integer, write a program that will detect errors in codewords in as many as k-1 positions and correct errors in as many as floor((k-1)/2) positions.

This program accomplishes these goals using a HTML/CSS GUI. All logic and HTML element manipulation is done in strict javascript. This program uses no external javascript libraries. This program features user input sanitzation to prevent runtime errors.

Source code is extensively labelled to assist with readability.
